title: "Development"

This project only comes with the default `gatsby develop` script running, but has an alias set up in case you want to add in any additional tools for development mode.

The command `npm run develop` is aliased to `gatsby develop` so you could add to that script e.g. `gatsby develop && npm run my-script`
