title: "Building"
---

This project only comes with several `build` scripts.

1.  `gatsby build` - The default Gatsby build script
2.  `npm run build` - Alias that by default only calls `gatsby build` but can be added to for additional build steps.
3.  `npm run build:pp` - The Gatsby build script with the [`--prefix-paths`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/path-prefix/) flag.
