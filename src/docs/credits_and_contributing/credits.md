Thanks to the following projects for inspiration and direction:

* [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)

  The reason for the party...

* [gatsby-advanced-starter](https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter)

  Most of the Remark work was done here. Really good examples of many aspects of Gatsby here.

* [gatsby-starter-docs](https://github.com/ericwindmill/gatsby-starter-docs)

  I was inspired to make a slimmed down version of this. Itself a fork of `gatsby-advanced-starter`, the <TableOfContents / > component system started here. Has many more heavy-duty features for a full Gatsby site. (blog, tags, categories, etc.)
