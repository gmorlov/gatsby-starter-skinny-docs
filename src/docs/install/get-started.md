Now that you have cloned the repo, run this to start the Gatsby development server:

```
cd [YOUR-DIRECTORY]
```

```
npm install
```

```
gatsby develop
```

Head to http://localhost:8000/ to see the starter site. Start editing/deleting the starter Markdown files or styles to your liking. Next, we need to explore the basic development process of Gatsby.
